<p>Key idea: Chu, et. al describe a <em>parser/generator</em> that takes a parametrized
convex program, converts it to an equivalent SOCP, and generates code that can
be used to solve the problem.</p>

<h2 id="novel-contributions">Novel contributions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>SOCPs encompass a large class of convex programs; previous canonicalization
suites targeted smaller problem classes, like QPs or QCQPs. Recall
  that linear programs, QPs, and QCQPs are all SOCPs.</li>
  <li>Problem parameters must enter through specific functions; this interface
allows the code generator to circumvent all floating point operations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Problem convexity is verified via disciplined convex programming.</p>

<h2 id="problem-statement-canonicalization">Problem Statement: Canonicalization</h2>

<p>The canonicalization takes as input a convex optimization problem and outputs
an equivalent SOCP.</p>

<p><strong>Input</strong>: convex optimization problem description.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\optmin{x}{f_{0}(x; \alpha)}{f_i(x; \alpha) \leq g_i(x; \alpha),
\quad i=1\ldots,m \\ & & & u_i(x; \alpha) = v_i(x; \alpha)} %]]></script>

<p><strong>Output</strong>: equivalent second-order cone program</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\optmin{x, s}{c^Tx}{Ax + s = b, \quad s \in \mathcal{K},}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{K}</script> is the cross product of <script type="math/tex">q</script>
second-order cones and <script type="math/tex">\{0\}^r</script>.</p>

<h2 id="background-disciplined-convex-programming">Background: Disciplined Convex Programming</h2>

<p>The three building blocks of DCP are atoms, expressions, and convex problems;
atoms are the atomic units, expressions build from atoms, and convex problems
build from expressions.</p>

<h3 id="atoms">Atoms</h3>
<p>An atom is a built-in function like plus, minus, sum, maximum, square, or norm.
There are three classes of atoms: parametric atoms, scalar atoms, and
vector atoms. All atoms return scalars, except scalar atoms evaluated at
vector arguments return elementwise-transformed vectors.</p>

<p>Atoms have three key properties: (1) output sign, (2) monotonicity per argument,
and (3) curvature. The output sign can depend upon the signs of inputs;
a vector is positive if and only if every entry is positive. The monotonicity
of parametric atoms depends upon the sign of their parameters.</p>

<h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>An expression is a vector variable or an atom evaluated at a subexpression
(note the recursive definition); the leaves of expressions are the variables,
internal nodes are atoms, and each atom is evaluated at its children. For
example, <script type="math/tex">\phi^{\operatorname{square}}</script> is an atom, but
<script type="math/tex">\phi^{\operatorname{square}}(x)</script> a subexpression. The sign of an expression
is computed bottom-up; variables have unknown sign (but some atoms,
like the square atom, have sign independent of its inputs).</p>

<p>Convexity is also verified in a bottom-up fashion. All variables are affine;
<script type="math/tex">\phi(g_1(x), \ldots, g_n(x); \alpha)</script> is convex if <script type="math/tex">\phi</script> is convex and
one of the following holds for each <script type="math/tex">i</script>: (1) <script type="math/tex">g_i</script> is affine,
(2) <script type="math/tex">\phi</script> is increasing in the <script type="math/tex">i</script>th argument and <script type="math/tex">g_i</script> is convex,
or (3) <script type="math/tex">\phi</script> is decreasing in the <script type="math/tex">i</script>th argument and
<script type="math/tex">g_i</script> is concave.</p>

<h3 id="convexity">Convexity</h3>
<p>Convexity can be determined by the curvature of all its expressions and atoms.
Note that DCP-compliance is sound but not complete.</p>

<h2 id="canonicalization">Canonicalization</h2>

<p>The first step is to convert the original problem into <strong>Smith form</strong>.
A new variable <script type="math/tex">t_i</script> is introduced for each node <script type="math/tex">i</script> in the expression
tree, with <script type="math/tex">t_0</script> mapping to the root of the tree; then, the problem
is written as “minimize <script type="math/tex">t_0</script>” subject to <script type="math/tex">t_i</script> equals the <script type="math/tex">i</script>-th
subexpression, for each subexpression <script type="math/tex">i</script>. In order to convexify
the smith problem, the equality constraints <script type="math/tex">t_i = \phi_i(t_{i+1})</script>
for convex <script type="math/tex">\phi_i</script> are replaced with inequality constraints
<script type="math/tex">t_i \geq \phi_i(t_{i+1})</script>; this representation is known as <em>relaxed</em>
Smith form. It can be shown (this is key) that the optimal solution of
the relaxed Smith form of a DCP-compliant problem is optimal for the original
problem as well.</p>

<p>In the final step, nonlinear functions in the relaxed Smith form are
replaced with the “optimal value of a partially-specified convex optimization
problem.” This is known as the graph implementation for convex problems.
Finally, the resulting SOCP is converted into standard form.</p>

<p><em>Note that the only work done is copying problem data into SOCP data.</em></p>

<h2 id="commentary">Commentary</h2>
<p>CVXPY (version &lt; 1.0) more or less implements this paper – it canonicalizes
its problems by converting them into cone programs, including SOCPs. You can
see this in the source code (available on Github): each atom implements a
function named
graph_implementation, and this function is invoked during canonicalization.</p>
