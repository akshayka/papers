<p>This paper by folks at Ben Recht’s lab describes a paradigm for distributed
computation that centers on stateless functions or microservices; their
description is accompanied by <a href="http://pywren.io/">PyWren</a>, an open-source
implementation of their computation model.</p>

<p>Here’s the thesis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this paper we argue that a serverless execution model
with stateless functions can enable radically-simpler, fundamentally
elastic, and more user-friendly distributed data
processing systems. In this model, we have one simple
primitive: users submit [single-threaded] functions that are executed in a
remote container; the functions are stateless as all the state for the
function, including input, output is accessed from shared remote storage</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../assets/pywren_arch.png" alt="PyWren Architecture" /></p>

<p>Their implementation is powered by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS
Lambda</a>, a service that lets users “run code
without provisioning or managing servers.” A key property of Lambda is that you
only pay for what you compute, and no more: i.e., you’re billed by compute time
instead of by uptime. That makes billing straightforward, but it doesn’t make
it cheap: the paper states that Lambda is 2x more expensive than on-demand
instances.</p>

<p>The primary motivation of PyWren is to make distributed computation easy
and fairly performant. From the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our proposal in this paper was motivated by a professor
of computer graphics at UC Berkeley asking us “Why is
there no cloud button?” He outlined how his students simply
wish they could easily “push a button” and have their
code – existing, optimized, single-machine code – running
on the cloud. Thus, our fundamental goal here is
to allow as many users as possible to take existing, legacy
code and run it in parallel, exploiting elasticity</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="parallelism-and-the-pywren-api">Parallelism and the PyWren API</h3>
<p>Many workloads apply the same function in a parallel fashion — i.e.,
many workloads reduce to the functional <code>map</code> (e.g., stochastic gradient
descent). PyWren offers a simple functional API that implements map by
launching a separate stateless function for each element in the mapped-over
list; these functions can be executed in parallel over AWS Lambda. The following
code snippet, taken from pywren.io, is an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def my_function(b):
    x = np.random.normal(0, b, 1024)
    A = np.random.normal(0, b, (1024, 1024))
    return np.dot(A, x)

  pwex = pywren.default_executor()
  res = pwex.map(my_function, np.linspace(0.1, 100, 1000))
</code></pre>

<p>My opinion is that PyWren’s main appeal is its ease of use. If parallelizing
code is really as easy as the above code snippet, then that’s really will
make distributed computing more accessible. (It might even make it so
accessible that people may use it when they could instead get cheaper and
better performance out of a multi-threaded, single-machine implementation …)</p>

<h3 id="disaggregation">Disaggregation</h3>
<p>PyWren disaggregates storage from compute; indeed, even beyond PyWren,
disaggregation is an industry-wide trend. Remote flash is however tricky to
get right. The author’s cite statistics showing that RF beats local SSDs
on their particular AWS configuration, but I suspect that this is an artifact.</p>

<p>Ben Recht gave an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=lsjXA78n0zg">interesting talk</a>
 that touched
on how one might use PyWren to scale up direct solve methods for linear systems
(skip to about 15:20 for the discussion on PyWren).</p>
